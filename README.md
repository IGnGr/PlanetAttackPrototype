# PR - Planet Attack

![Planet Attack](screenshots/Menu.png "Menu")

## Description

An adaptation of the classic game "Missile Command" from Atari, released in 1980.

The goal was to maintain the game feeling and the original idea.

## How to Play

The game is controlled with the mouse.

- Mouse movement: Aim with the reticle
- Left mouse button: Shoot

You must protect your energy nodes from enemy fire. To do this, you need to shoot the missiles heading towards them.

Explosions generate a shockwave that will destroy any other projectiles that come afterwards, which in turn will generate more points.

## Implementation
The following classes have been used to adapt the game logic:

### AnimationAutoDestroy Class
Class used to make explosions disappear after their animation ends. If removed directly, it looks quite bad.

### BackgroundScroller Class
Class used to make the background dynamic, both the rotating planet and the moving background. It greatly improves the presentation.

### EnemySpawnController Class
Class that controls the appearance and instantiation of enemy missiles based on a spawn rate. It sets the origin and destination of each missile to be random.

### ExplosionController Class
Class to control the life of explosions generated by the player's shots with the consequent update of the player's score. It is used to correctly add points by chaining explosions and doubling the points obtained from them. Additionally, it generates a points indication in the onDestroy of the explosion.

### GameController Class
Class to manage the end of the game and return to the main menu.

### MenuController Class
Class responsible for transitions in the main menu to show its different sections (options, how to play, and credits).

### PlayerController Class
Class that manages the logic related to the player's shots and the movement of the turrets that perform them.

### PointsPopUpController Class
Very simple class that displays the correct value of the points generated in each explosion.

### ProjectileController Class
Class that handles the logic of projectiles. It manages collisions, object life, and generating explosions when the projectile detonates.

### ScoreController Class
Class that displays the current points value and lives in the UI.

### TurretController Class
Class that manages the rotation of the turrets. 

The player fires with 4 turrets, which are managed to shoot the one closest to the target. The turrets only rotate 45 degrees to each side, creating angles the player cannot reach, making them need to anticipate and be proactive.

### AudioController Class
Class to manage the music change in the game scene.
